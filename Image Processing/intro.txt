Image processing is used by a lot of companies. Instagram processes images before posting it, it adds some filters
and crops them to look nicer and save money. Original Images are more than 5MB, and if instagram started uploading
original images, it would be much costlier to store images on servers.

Same thing is done by udemy, they compress the video which saves them space and money and, it also helps people with
poor internet connection to watch the video easily
